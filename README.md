## Nurture: An AI-powered nutrition app for pregnant mothers

Created by Ashrith Athmaram, Daivik Patel, Shrenik Patel, and Weilin Chu 

## What is Nurture?

Do you know that 90% of pregnant women in high-income countries do not eat enough of the nutrients they need to have healthy pregnancies… and you know what’s worse? Currently, there are way more undernourished births than there were 10 years ago. But why? Besides lack of knowledge and budget considerations, people also have more dietary restrictions now, so it’s hard to figure out what to eat. 

And so we created a nutrient tracker tailored to the different needs of each stage of pregnancy. Whether you’re vegan or have crazy allergies, Nurture tells you which and how much of specific nutrients you should eat and why, checks if you reach those goals, and even makes recipes for you to try based on your diet and the ingredients you have on hand!

## How is it different?

But what does our app do that other alternatives like doctors can’t do? Well, it’s free and easy access for you 24/7 between more limited doctor visits. It educates you in a clean and easy way, is tailored to your needs, and tracks your progress in a way books and webpages can’t. We compiled a lot of research from reputable sources on how nutrient needs differ as the stage of pregnancy changes in order to make our databases.

## What's next?

We want to let people add custom ingredients and diets that aren’t on our list. We want to form a community by letting users add and share their own recipes and questions in-app. Since another major cause of malnutrition is money, we plan to implement price estimates and low-price meal options to help people with that concern.

Thank you!
