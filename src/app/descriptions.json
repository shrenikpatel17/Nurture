    "week1": "During the first week of pregnancy, which is typically counted from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period, conception occurs. At this point, the woman has not yet ovulated or released an egg. The fertilization of the egg by sperm usually occurs around the middle of the menstrual cycle, closer to the second week of pregnancy.",
    "week2": "During the second week of pregnancy, the woman is still in the pre-ovulation phase, with the egg preparing to be released. Ovulation typically occurs around the middle of the menstrual cycle, and during this week, the egg is released from the ovary and begins its journey down the fallopian tube. If fertilization takes place with sperm during this time, the zygote forms, initiating the early stages of embryonic development.",
    "week3": "In the third week of pregnancy, the fertilized egg, now called a blastocyst, undergoes rapid cell division as it travels down the fallopian tube towards the uterus. By the end of the week, the blastocyst reaches the uterus and starts the process of implantation into the uterine lining. The placenta begins to form, and this crucial organ will provide nutrients and support for the developing embryo in the weeks to come.",
    "week4": "During the fourth week of pregnancy, the blastocyst officially implants into the uterine lining, signaling the start of the embryonic stage. Cells continue to divide and differentiate, forming the three primary layers that will eventually develop into various organs and tissues. The early development of the neural tube, which will give rise to the brain and spinal cord, also begins during this crucial period of embryonic growth.",
    "week5": "In the fifth week of pregnancy, the embryo undergoes rapid development, and the neural tube continues to close, forming the early structure of the brain and spinal cord. The heart begins to beat, and the circulatory system starts to take shape, allowing blood to flow through the developing embryo. Additionally, limb buds emerge, and the foundation for the eyes, ears, and other major organs is laid.",
    "week6": "In the sixth week of pregnancy, the embryo experiences further development, and the heart begins to divide into chambers. Limb buds become more defined, and facial features, including the eyes and nose, start to take shape. Additionally, basic structures for the digestive and respiratory systems begin to form, marking a crucial stage in the overall organ development of the growing fetus.",
    "week7": "In the seventh week of pregnancy, the embryo undergoes rapid growth, and limb development progresses, with fingers and toes becoming more distinct. The brain continues to develop, and facial features become more refined, including the formation of the upper lip and nose. By the end of this week, the embryo is transitioning into the fetal stage, and various internal organs, such as the liver and kidneys, are actively forming.",
    "week8": "During the eighth week of pregnancy, the developing embryo transitions into the fetal stage, and key organs continue to form and mature. Limbs elongate, and the fingers and toes become more defined. The eyes, which initially form on the sides of the head, move closer together, and facial features continue to develop, including the formation of the ears and a more pronounced nose.",
    "week9": "In the ninth week of pregnancy, the fetal stage progresses with rapid development. The tail, present in earlier stages, starts to disappear as the fetus takes on a more human-like appearance. Organ systems continue to mature, and the external genitalia begins to differentiate, though it may not be visually distinguishable on ultrasound until later in the pregnancy.",
    "week10": "In the tenth week of pregnancy, the fetus transitions into the fetal period, marking the end of the embryonic stage. All major organ systems are present and beginning to function, and the fetus is now less susceptible to developmental disruptions. Limb movements increase, and the fetus starts to exhibit reflexes, although these movements are not yet felt by the mother.",
    "week11": "In the eleventh week of pregnancy, the developing fetus experiences continued growth and refinement of its features. The external genitalia becomes more distinguishable, allowing for gender identification through ultrasound, although it may not always be accurate at this early stage. The fetus is now capable of a variety of movements, even though the mother may not feel them yet.",
    "week12": "In the twelfth week of pregnancy, the fetus undergoes significant development, with facial features becoming more defined, and the external genitalia fully formed, allowing for accurate gender identification during ultrasound examinations. The kidneys are functional, and the fetus begins to produce urine. At this stage, the risk of miscarriage significantly decreases, and many of the critical developmental milestones have been achieved.",
    "week13": "In the thirteenth week of pregnancy, the fetus is entering the second trimester, and many of the major organ systems are now in place and functioning. The facial features continue to develop, and the fetus's head becomes more proportional to the body. Limb movements are more coordinated, and the fetus may begin to make sucking motions with its mouth.",
    "week14": "In the fourteenth week of pregnancy, the fetus continues to grow, and its facial features become more refined. Fine hair called lanugo begins to cover the body, providing warmth. The fetus's limb movements become more coordinated, and it may start to make facial expressions, even though the mother may not yet feel these movements.",
    "week15": "In the fifteenth week of pregnancy, the fetus undergoes continued growth and development. The bones are ossifying, and the skeleton is becoming more defined. The fetus's digestive system is maturing, and it is now capable of swallowing and producing meconium, which will be the first bowel movement after birth.",
    "week16": "In the sixteenth week of pregnancy, the fetus experiences significant growth, and its body becomes more proportionate. Facial features are more distinct, and the ears are in their final position. The skin is thin and translucent, and the baby starts to develop a layer of fine hair called lanugo, which plays a role in regulating body temperature.",
    "week17": "In the seventeenth week of pregnancy, the fetus continues to grow, and its skeleton is hardening as bone tissue replaces cartilage. The umbilical cord, which connects the fetus to the placenta, strengthens and thickens to support the growing baby. The baby's movements become more noticeable, and the mother may start feeling the first flutters of fetal activity, known as quickening.",
    "week18": "In the eighteenth week of pregnancy, the baby's growth continues with the development of more defined facial features. The fetus's ears are fully formed and capable of hearing, and it may respond to sounds from the external environment. Additionally, the baby's nervous system is maturing, allowing for more coordinated movements, and the mother may begin to feel more pronounced kicks and movements.",
    "week19": "In the nineteenth week of pregnancy, the baby's senses are further developing, with the ability to taste and swallow amniotic fluid. Vernix caseosa, a protective coating, begins to cover the baby's skin, and fine hair called lanugo continues to grow. The baby's movements become more coordinated, and the mother may feel more pronounced kicks and stretches as the baby explores its limited space in the uterus.",
    "week20": "In the twentieth week of pregnancy, the baby reaches the halfway point of gestation, and its growth continues with the development of more defined features. The baby's skin becomes covered in vernix caseosa, a protective layer, and lanugo, a fine hair. The mother may start to feel more distinct movements, and the baby's gender can often be identified during an ultrasound examination.",
    "week21": "In the twenty-first week of pregnancy, the baby's growth and development include the maturation of the digestive system, where the intestines start to absorb sugars. The baby's bone marrow is now responsible for producing blood cells, taking over from the liver and spleen.
